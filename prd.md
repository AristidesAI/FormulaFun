we are making a mobile unity iOS portrait game where you play as a formula one driver and you race against other drivers that are ML-agents. The goal of the player is to finish the race in first place. The game is played in portrait mode and the controls are simple. 

You steer with a left right button on the bottom of the screen, Your speed is controlled by a gearbox style knob that you turn up and down with your thumb - the speed knob sits between the left and right controls on the bottom of the screen.

Setup a venv for python Python 3.10.12 and install ML-agents. https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ml-agents@4.0/manual/Installation.html 

the game will use Assets/Racing Kit assets for the courses which will be procedurally generated using a set of rules we will define. 

Setup the mlagents to train a car to drive around the track, use the existing unity mlagents racing examples as a reference.
